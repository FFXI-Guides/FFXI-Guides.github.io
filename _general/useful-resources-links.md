Links and Resources
========================================
###### Author: Original by Daleterrence @ Bahamut, suggestions added from many people in the AzureSkies FFXI Community (Thank you!)

This page contains a collection of resources for information related to Final Fantasy XI, and tools to make your life easier in Vana'diel.

### Websites
- [BG Wiki](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Main_Page) - Your best source of information for content added post-Abyssea. Tends to be written in the view that you already understand the game well.
  - [User Templates](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Category:User_Page_Templates) - Helpful spreadsheets to keep track of progress for missions, trusts, home points, etc.
  - [EXP Camp Guide](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Fantastic_EXPs_and_Where_to_Find_Them) - A *fantastic* guide (I'm sorry) for finding where to go to level up.
  - [Graphics Enhancement Guide](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Graphics_Enhancement_Guide) - A guide explaining various graphical settings and other tools you can make use of to make your game look better, and run better. 
- [FFXIclopedia](https://antifandom.com/ffxiclopedia/wiki/Main_Page) - The less used wiki these days, but still very useful for information on older content and quests.
   - [Glossary of FFXI Terms and Community Slang](https://antifandom.com/ffxiclopedia/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XI_Dictionary_of_Terms_and_Slang) - A guide for helping you understand what the heck we're all talking about. 
  - [Macro back up guide](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Macro) - A page explaining how to backup your in-game macros either locally, or on the server. 
- [FFXIAH](https://ffxiah.com) - Your best friend for selling or buying anything off the Auction House, allows you to look up prices for items no matter where you are. Also has forums which contain quite a few useful guides for jobs but I wouldn't really recommend posting on them anymore. 
- [FFXI Graphical Database](https://ff11db.sakura.ne.jp/database/) - A website with all of the weapons and armour in the game displayed visually. You will need a translation extension for your browser if you do not speak Japanese. Click [here](https://ff11db.sakura.ne.jp/database/graphi/buki/index.html) to go to the weapons top-page or [here](https://ff11db.sakura.ne.jp/database/graphi/bougu/index.html) for the armour top-page. 
- [Geomancer Spell Checklist by](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oo_1p1nEAzCOcHS6LBlqHQQ7KTKAV4GJS1Seb5LhwqA/edit?usp=sharing) - Does what it says on the tin, a beautifully laid out spreadsheet template for keeping track of what GEO spells you still need to learn with costs and locations included. Made by Sylvievie @ Bahamut.
- [Skillchain Calculator](https://renkei-navi.onrender.com/en) - A fantastic little website for working out skillchains, it's the best skillchain calculator I've ever seen. 
### Tools
- [Windower](https://windower.net/) - The most commonly used tool alongside FFXI, and I would strongly recommend using it. Provides plugins and addons that enhance FFXI's functionality and UI, making the game much more comfy to play. 
- [Ashita](https://docs.ashitaxi.com/) - The Windower alternative, provides more of an up-to-date feel compared to the quite dated Windower. Does mostly the same thing Windower does, perhaps with less functionality for retail XI. Tends to require more technical know-how to get the most out of it.
- [AltanaView](https://github.com/CAProjects/AltanaViewer/) - Allows you to view any armour, weapons, NPCs or effects from the game, can also play some of the game's music and display some of the game's UI elements. Requires FFXI to be installed. 
- [FFXI Calculator](http://www.ffxicalculator.com/) - Used for the slightly more mathier stuff in FFXI, can be used to work out haste cap, magic haste cap, and Store TP values alongside your delay to determine how much TP you earn per hit, which is very useful to know for DDs. Also contains a skillchain calculator so you can work out what options you have available to you ahead of time. Somewhat outdated but still good for most things.
- [Whereisdi](https://whereisdi.com/) - Allows you to see where the Domain Invasion battle content is currently taking place, crowdsourced from users of the WhereIsDI addon for Windower and Ashita.

### Mods
- [Remapster](https://remapster.com/downloads/) - A map mod to vastly improve the in-game maps, adding extra information in an easy to digest way and greatly improving readability. Requires the [XIPivot](https://github.com/HealsCodes/XIPivot) addon for Windower and Ashita to function correctly without issues.
  - A guide to installing XIPivot and Remapster can be found [here](https://remapster.com/2022/7/26/map-pack-2/).
- [4 GB RAM Patch](https://github.com/ThornyFFXI/LargeAddressAware/releases/) - A small utility which allows FFXI (or any 32-bit program) to use up to 4 GB of RAM instead of the default 2 GB due to its age. Very helpful when using any mods that may require more memory to function correctly.
  - Is applied directly to pol.exe, so requires repatching each time the game updates.
  - If you do not trust a random .exe on the internet, you can replicate this exact utility with some technical knowledge using the guide [here](https://gisgeek.blogspot.com/2012/01/set-32bit-executable-largeaddressaware.html).
- [dgVoodoo](https://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/dgVoodoo2/) - A utility that acts as a proxy for games running on older DirectX versions, allowing the game to communicate with your computer's hardware easier. Greatly improves FFXI's performance, especially if using mods which may be more intensive for FFXI.
  - A guide for setting this up can be found [here](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/DgVoodoo_Setup_Guide) on BG Wiki.
