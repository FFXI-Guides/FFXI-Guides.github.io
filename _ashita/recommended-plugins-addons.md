This guide provides a list of available plugins and addons for the addon launcher Ashita v4 used to extend functionality for Final Fantasy XI. This guide does not cover multiboxing or private server-specific addons in any amount of detail.

###### A ⭐ by the plugin's name denotes that a plugin is *strongly* recommended or very helpful. 

## What plugins exist?

Plugins are separately loaded to addons, as they are pre-compiled dll files stored in the `plugin` folder. Configurations for these plugins can usually be found in the `config` folder.

If there is not a link on the plugin name itself, it is already included in v4 repository that you downloaded in order to use Ashita.

* [Bellhop](https://github.com/ThornyFFXI/Bellhop/)

* [Sequencer](https://github.com/ThornyFFXI/Sequencer) ⭐

In `polplugins` folder, these 2 addons also exist which handle interactions in the PlayOnline Launcher itself.

    * Used for sandboxing instances of Ashita, required when you are running multiple instances of FFXI.

## What addons exist?

Addons should be extracted to a folder which is stored within `addons` folder.

* [xitools](https://github.com/mousseng/xitools/)
    * Another UI replacement (like HXUI)

    * This repository also includes a looot of other addons which may be useful that I've described above as well.
* [whereisdi](https://github.com/loonsies/whereisdi) ⭐
    * It is [https://whereisdi.com](https://whereisdi.com) in addon form, replicates functionality of the site ingame. For the truly lazy among us (or for those who cannot alt tab out of the game).

## Special mention

This one kinda straddles the line of plugin/addon because it is a completely separate program and does require some more setup than any other plugins or addons for Ashita, but I think this could be quite useful so I will add it here.

* [Electron-FFXI-Atlas](https://github.com/miguelstrife/Electron-FFXI-Atlas)
    * Displays zone maps from FFXI and tracks your character position in real time in a separate window.

## What addons should you *not* run on Retail?

You could be banned permanently if you enable these on retail, so use them at your own risk.

Also I'm not going to link to these directly, since they are not necessary for playing on retail.
