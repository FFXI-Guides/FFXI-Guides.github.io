*This guide assumes you do not want to farm and want to just get to the Wave 3 boss quickly*

## Wave 1

* Pull statues on BLUE ![Blue](/assets/images/battle-content/dynamis-divergence/20px-snowflake.png) eyes if your alliance does primarily magic damage (Leaden Salute, Tachi: Jinpu, etc.)

* Pull statues on GREEN ![Green](/assets/images/battle-content/dynamis-divergence/20px-moon.png) eyes if your alliance does primarily physical damage (Savage Blade) (MOST LIKELY SCENARIO)

* Statues with RED ![Red](/assets/images/battle-content/dynamis-divergence/20px-cherry_petal.png) eyes will spawn an NM

* Statues of NO COLOR (the statue does not switch between BLUE/GREEN) will spawn Aurix (loot pi√±ata NM) as well as the normal mobs.

There is only one statue in your way between the start and the boss.  Grab it and kill it and the few mobs that spawn or have your COR Leaden Salute it dead.

### Wave Boss - Overseer's Tombstone

For the boss, you can just have your COR Leaden Salute it down again or you can all smack it down.  The AOE isn't terrible but your WHM may not want to deal with it.  It dies quickly either way.  Fight it where it spawns and have everyone else in the corner to the right of it to avoid aggro upon spawning Wave 2 (multiple statues will spawn on the ramp).
