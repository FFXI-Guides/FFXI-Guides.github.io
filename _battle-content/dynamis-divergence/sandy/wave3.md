## Wave 3

All 8 circles will now need to be defeated to weaken the boss.    

### Circles

Each circle has two sets of mobs on either end of it - 3 volte regular mobs (~100k HP) and then one volte NM (~400k HP).  The regular mobs will be named something like "Volte Thief", a clear indication of what job it is.  The NM will have a sometimes confusing name like "Volte Duelist" (not a RDM).  

The tank can pull each side by casting Cursed Sphere on the one furthest away from the circle.  This will give them initial hate on them making it easier to pop a JA and keep them handled.

Before you pull, you’ll want to check for any problem mobs.  These are mobs you want the RDM to cast silence on as you’re pulling so they don’t do nasty things to your group like aoe sleep or petrify or stun.  

Those are, in order of priority : BLU > RDM > GEO > BRD > BLM > (other mages)  

If there’s only one in the group including both sides, and the NM isn’t bad, tank can feel free to pull both sides.  Use your best judgment - it’s really annoying for the RDM if there’s a WHM NM that’s going to be hard to silence and will keep silena-ing the other mobs, for example.  

Keep WAR/DRG mobs faced away from the group.  

Fight mobs like BST, COR, WHM last because their 2hrs are disruptive if they fire off.  

Savage Blade is free game on the regular Volte mobs but the Volte NMs have the WS wall mechanic so don't wall your chosen Savage Blade user(s).

Some of the NMs should be handled with extra care - see below.  

#### Volte NMs:
* **Volte Cleaver (WAR)** - Fell Cleave will mess your group up, don’t stand in front of him.  Tank holds it facing away and everyone else stands behind it at max distance. Tank take extra care not to lose aggro on this one, because the second someone pulls hate is exactly when he’ll want to use fell cleave.
* **Volte Trainer (BST)** - Tank just needs to Fealty / Tenebrae runes to avoid the Charm.
* **Volte Conductor (BRD)** - Has Resist Silence traits so will be annoying to silence.
* **Volte Shinobi (NIN)** - Mijin Gakure will do single target damage to the tank.  It doesn’t seem like this magic bursts anymore so its not as scary but feel free to use JAs when it gets low just in case. (WHM - Sacrosanctity, PLD - Rampart, RUN - Valiance)
* **Volte Highwind (DRG)** - Sonic Thrust will wreck your party, don’t stand in front of him and tank ensure that it’s facing away from everyone.  Will Gierskogul with the shock spikes potency DRGs could only dream of - CORs can stand back and shoot and WHM can Asylum to avoid the stuns, otherwise just slog through it.
* **Volte Joiner (BLU)** - RDM should Stymie silence this one. AoE entomb etc, is pretty bad. If Stymie is not up for whatever reason, tank should grab it and hold it away from everyone until silence lands.
* **Volte Communer (GEO)** - Tank can stand in where the mobs are to have the bubble placed there, then run the mobs away from the bubble. Point and laugh at the tank when the bubble is Geo-Gravity and it takes them forever to get back to the group.
* **Volte Illusionist (RDM)** - RDM should Stymie silence this one if you have it. If you don’t have two RDM the Joiner has higher priority and you just need to suffer the paralyga/slowga until silence lands. Tank can hold it away from everyone until silence lands as well but it’s not as devastating as the BLU.  Everyone please tip your RDM if slowga lands and they have to re-haste everyone.
* The rest of the NMs are straight forward.  

Once both sides of the circle are clear, it’s time to take the circle down.  The Disjoined Elvaan ??? will open with an often very disruptive aoe so it’s best that this doesn’t hit the whole group.  The tank will run to the other side of the circle (it doesn’t aggro) in those zones to pull it.  Flash at over 20’ and do your best to hold hate.  It will only do aoe damage if someone pulls hate within that 20’ range.  There is also a chance that Aurix comes out of the Circle on pull so try to kill him before moving on to the circle.  

The disjoined will spawn from the circle and come after the tank but as long as no one does anything to it, they can super tank it and not worry too much (it’s not very dangerous).  The aoe damage from the circle is not devastating so don’t feel the need to burn JAs to hold hate, just do what you can.  

Just a note - if someone accidently hits the circle while you're clearing out the Volte mobs, everyone should switch to the circle and focus it down before returning to the regular Volte mobs.  


### Wave Boss - Disjoined Elvaan  

![Disjoined Elvaan](https://www.bg-wiki.com/images/thumb/2/23/Disjoined_Elvaan.png/158px-Disjoined_Elvaan.png)

Soul Voice, etc.  and fully buff before starting.  Use 2hrs for this fight.   

The boss has the ability to summon Odin and Zansetsuken everyone, so everyone needs to keep reraise up at all times - not optional!  He can also be summoned multiple times so if he is summoned he will eat your reraise and you need to reapply it.  

At 79%, 59%, 39%, and 19% there will be four random adds that pop.  It’s important that everyone switches to the adds but does not engage any COR or WHM at first.  If there’s a BST, the tank will need to make sure fealty/tenebrae runes are up as getting charmed will reset their hate on the boss. Take care of beefy adds like the WAR and DRG that can make trouble with AoEs.  RDM should silence any BLU/RDM right away (and then any other mages).  

**Important note about WHM/COR Volte** - once the other adds are down, RDM will bind and gravity the WHM/COR and the tank will take the boss away.  DDs can grab some TP on the boss while that’s happening.  Once the RDM confirms bind/gravity is all set and the boss is far enough away (down the ramp a bit is fine), DDs go ham on the WHM/COR.  If you have a DRG they can leg sweep and you can kill the add before it does Wild Card / Benediction (without doing all this kiting) but it’s a little riskier.

### Role Specific Notes  

#### Tank  
He’s not very dangerous (to you!!), tank away.  After the initial hate spike on pull, save your JAs for when adds pop (aoe -> pop JA).  Majesty cures help a lot when he starts doing aoe circle blades (if you’re pld).  

#### RDM
Silence is your greatest debuff priority on him.  

Keep him debuffed and let your COR know when you reapply Dia III so they can light shot it.  

You will be busy again when adds pop.  Let your team know when bind/gravity is on the WHM/COR if they pop so the tank knows when it's safe to pull the boss away.  

#### BRD
SVCC at start, keep an eye out for buffs to finale.  You may reach hate cap at lower % so can switch to only magical WS to help (Leaden Salute).  

#### DD  
Smash away, feel free to pop all your JAs and 2hr. Use high jump/super jump appropriately.  Switch quickly to the adds when they pop and don't touch the WHM/COR Volte until it's time.   

Whoever is doing Armor Break / Shell Crusher / Tachi: Ageha ensure it is applied and kept on the whole time.  

#### COR  
Dia the light shot that the RDM puts out, keep rolls up.  You may reach hate cap at lower % so can switch to only magical WS to help (Leaden Salute).  

#### WHM  
Keep everybody up!  You can help silence too on the adds.  The NM can do some AoE WS that can be nasty so be alert.
