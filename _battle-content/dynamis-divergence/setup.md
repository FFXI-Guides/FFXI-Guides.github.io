## Party Comp
* Tank
* WHM
* RDM 
* BRD 
* COR 
* DD

Wave 3 can be cleared with a well geared group of 6, ex. R25+ Nyame on RDM/BRD/COR/DD.  This is not mentioned as a hard requirement - just a guideline on what your overall group should look like strength-wise.  Even that has some wiggle room as I believe the W3 boss has a 30 minute enrage timer and the boss takes about 20 minutes with that group.  You can bring in up to 18 people and in fact most groups I've done Dynamis with will have one "carry group" with their best buffers/DD and then a tank party/offparty.  

If you have multiple parties, try to have a COR + BRD + healer in each one.  

It can be helpful to have one person calling targets (probably the tank but it can be anyone who is comfortable) for circles or boss adds.  

This is a long event and focus may wane.  Don't be afraid to make friendly callouts if songs will wear (don't want to lose that 5th song) or rolls have been off for a while or reraise is missing (and don't take it personally if someone gently reminds you, it happens to all of us).  The run will go best if everyone is comfortable calling out buffs/debuffs/changes - if that one person who's noticed the 5th song is about to wear is afraid to say something, then everyone is worse off for it.    




### Helpful (but not required)
**GEO**: Having a GEO and Geo-Malaise (even as nerfed as it is in here!) will enable hybrids to shine.  If you have a GEO, you can do Hot Shot, Tachi: Jinpu, Blade: Chi, etc. which can easily hit for capped damage with enough ranks in your Nyame.  Even if your setup doesn't have strong hybrids available, Geo-Frailty or Geo-Fury are strong and Indi-Torpor can help a lot with the evasiveness of Wave 3.

**BST**: Generous Arthur is incredible. If the only thing you did in the entire run was run up to the wave 3 boss and Purulent Ooze you will have done 2M damage.  Corrosive Ooze is also -33%  attack down/defense down and keeping that up on wave2/wave3 boss makes a huge difference.

### Before you go
Everyone **needs** multiple reraise items.  Grab a scroll of reraise and reraiser/hi-reraiser from the curio moogle.  Bring food, remedy, panacea, vile elixir/+1 as well.

You should have good hybrid/DT sets or you’ll have a bad time.  There are lots of surprise aoes that happen so make sure your sets are all reasonably sturdy.  For example if you have a really squishy WS set or JA set, shore those up with DT so you don’t get a surprise mijin gakure that floors you.

There is a WS wall mechanic for all the significant mobs here (big bosses and NMs).  Your main DD needs to also be /drg because the main wave3 boss has so much health they will inevitably hit hate cap.  Plan your setup accordingly so you don’t have everyone using the same weapon skills.  Only 1-2 Savage Blade users preferably.

#### Some WS alternatives to Savage Blade (assuming no prema)  
* WAR: Calamity (Ikenga’s axe)  
* COR: Hot Shot (Fomalhaut)  
* RDM: Black Halo (Maxentius)  
* BRD: Rudra’s Storm  
* DRG: Impulse Drive (Shining One)  


## Role Expectations 

### Tank  

* Lead the run  

Your pulls, however big or small, will dictate the pace of the run.  You could pull the entire zone and not die but everyone will lag out and have a bad time, so be mindful of your group and don't overwhelm them.  Your BLU spells also have a limit of 15 mobs tagged at a time.  

The color of the statue's eyes also do different things based on the zone and you want to pull on the color that befits your group.

### WHM  

* Keep everyone up
* Keep everyone buffed

Some zones will be busier than others - like Sandy has orcs with counterstance that can floor people in seconds.  

Barthundra / Barsleep are usually my go-tos for barspells.

Make sure all of your sets have good survivability - if you're curing in squishy gear, you will eventually get taken out by a rogue Mijin Gakure.  

### RDM  

* Debuff key mobs
* Keep your group hasted
* DD

You're going to be spinning a lot of plates.  

Keep the group Haste II'd, Phalanx II'd, your magic users refreshed, etc.  

You want to be on top of silences for any pulls with (in priority order) BLU > RDM > GEO > BRD > BLM > (other mages).  

Distract III especially is huge in Wave3 and on bosses.  You don't have to full debuff every mob but you want to cripple the wave bosses and the volte NMs.  When you cast Dia III have a party macro or otherwise indicate to the COR that you have cast it to help them know when to Light Shot.  

You can /nin or /dnc and do excellent damage (which is required for a low man run) or you can /blm for sleepga and focus on buffs/debuffs/cc if you have the damage in the group to cover it.  

Make sure you have good hybrid/DT sets and can hit the accuracy requirements for Wave 3 (1600+).  If you're going to Savage Blade make sure there aren't too many other Savage Bladers.

### BRD  

* Keep 5 songs on
* Horde Lullaby
* DD

How strong you are will determine how strong your party is.  Clarion Call at the start of the run and ask the COR to Cutting Cards you.  Maintain your five songs for the run - this may require some gentle herding of your party to make sure they all stay by you during songs.  

Wave 1/2 - Honor March/MinV/MinIV/MinIII/Aria(if you have it)  
Wave 3 - Honor March/MinV/MinIV/Madrigal/Aria(if you have it)  

If you don't have Aria feel free to throw in another Minuet or Madrigal or even a Minne.  Keep an eye on everyone's accuracy and throw in that extra Madrigal if it looks dire.  

When the pulls come in, Horde Lullaby and keep things controlled.  You can then DD away!  Make sure you have good hybrid/DT sets and can hit the accuracy requirements for Wave 3 (1600+).  If you're going to Savage Blade make sure there aren't too many other Savage Bladers.

### COR  

* Focus Statues first
* Keep rolls on
* DD

Chaos/SAM all day unless you're only cutting through statues - then you can Tact/Misers.  

You are focusing down statues with Leaden Salute.  Statues have about 20k HP in Wave 1 and 25k HP in Wave 2 and with zone double dark weather it's not too difficult to hit even with the TP bonus gun.  

If your tank is pulling your way through the zone focus on taking out the statues first.  

If you're the one forging ahead and busting statues make sure you can do that reliably.  Resists can happen so if you're on the fence just make sure you have a little more TP than you think you need for any statues that would cause a problem if they resist (like trap statues that pop a lot of mobs).  

Make sure you have good hybrid/DT sets and can hit the accuracy requirements for Wave 3 (1600+).  If you're going to Savage Blade make sure there aren't too many other Savage Bladers.  Don't forget to Cutting Cards the BRD after they use Clarion Call at the start of the run.

### DD  

* Live
* DD

Make sure all of your sets have good survivability, even your JAs.  Sub /drg (unless you are DRG!) and take advantage of your hate shedding jumps.  

Keep an eye on your buffs and don't run away from the BRD or COR when they're rebuffing.  

Use your best judgment on mob selection and order.  Take care of problem mobs like BLUs, RDMs, WARs, and DRGs first and leave WHMs and BSTs and NINs for last.  

You get first dibs on Savage Blade if you don't have anything stronger but try to run something else if you're able.

On Wave 2 / Wave 3 boss, you should figure out who is doing Armor Break / Shell Crusher / Tachi: Ageha ahead of time.
