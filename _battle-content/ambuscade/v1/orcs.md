Ambuscade V1 - Orcs
=====================================

This is a short guide to explain the mechanics of the V1 Orc Ambuscade. Overall quite a simple fight, as long as you have some way of silencing or crowd controlling the enemies, and enough damage to chew through them quickly, you should be fine.

## All Orc Enemies
### TP Moves
- **Orcish Counterstance** - Grants a Counterstance effect to the enemy, avoid standing in front unless you are tanking. Can be dispelled. 
- **Arm Block** - Grants a Defence Bonus effect to the enemy. Can be dispelled, but hard to keep dispelled.
- **Howl** - Grants a Warcry effect to all nearby enemies, can be dispelled, but hard to keep dispelled.
- **Battle Dance** - Decent AoE damage, inflicts AoE DEX Down. 

## Bozzetto Crusader (**Boss**, PLD, All Difficulties)
### Abilities & Spells
- **Invincible**: Used at 75%/50%/25% on Very Difficult, values may be different on other difficulties.
- ![Important Mechanic!](assets/images/battle-content/ambuscade/v1/LHQ788w.png) **Aura Gimmick**: Gains a gold-red aura VFX every 15-20 seconds, granting all enemies significant damage reduction, and unlocking access to Manic Dance whilst it is active.
    - This aura is removed by using a weaponskill when behind it. This weaponskill does not need to deal damage, only hit. 
        - Recommended to have a support or weaker DD be assigned to remove the aura as needed.
    - If it dies before the other enemies, they will **permanently** gain the damage reduction effect. Strongly advised to kill it after the other enemies. 
- ![Important Mechanic!](assets/images/battle-content/ambuscade/v1/LHQ788w.png) **Manic Dance**: Only able to use when its aura is up, inflicts single-target Charm.
- **Veil of Chaos**: Slight knockback, inflicts AoE Amnesia, resets hate. 
- **Veil of Disarray**: Only used under 25% HP, inflicts AoE Stun, resets hate.
- **Berserker Dance**: Grants the enemy a Haste effect. Can be dispelled.
- **Tornado Edge**: Deals moderate damage and inflicts single-target Max HP Down, Max MP Down and Max TP Down.
- **Flash**: Casted typically on the player second on the hate list, it will briefly turn to do this, be mindful if counterstance is up, or you are trying to remove its aura.
- **Protect**/**Shell**: Casted on itself and other enemies, will do this prior to pull also, as such all enemies should be dispelled a couple times.

## Bozzetto Tamer (BST, Very Difficult)
### Abilities & Spells
- ![Important Mechanic!](assets/images/battle-content/ambuscade/v1/LHQ788w.png) **Fanatic Dance**: Only uses if the **Bozzetto's Hecteyes** is killed prior to it. Inflicts AoE Charm.
- **Familiar**: Used if the **Bozzetto's Hecteyes** is still alive at about 50% HP. Both the **Bozzetto Tamer** and **Bozzetto's Hecteyes** take double damage whilst its active.
- Assisted by **Bozzetto's Hecteyes**.
    - The hecteyes can cast **Paralyga**, **Silencega** and **Slowga** and has access to typical hecteye TP moves. Should be killed after the **Bozzetto Tamer** to prevent Charm.


## Bozzetto Reaver (DRK, Very Difficult)
### Abilities & Spells
- **Blood Weapon**: Not super threatening at all, can hurt a little. Will take double damage whilst its active.
- **Dread Spikes**: Can, of course, one shot a heavy DD. Should be dispelled immediately. Keep silenced to prevent them going up in the first place.
- **Break** - Single target, not a huge deal, just keep silenced.

## Bozzetto Duelist (RUN, Difficult/Very Difficult)
### Abilities & Spells
- **Elemental Sforzo**: Manageable, really, not much to say about it. Will take double damage from non-magic sources whilst its active.
- **Shock Spikes** - Incredibly potent, will typically reapply them if dispelled almost immediately, should be silenced before dispelling to prevent this.

## Bozzetto Pugilist (MNK, All Difficulties):
### Abilities & Spells
- **Hundred Fists**: Not super threatening but can get dangerous if it has used Counterstance and is targetting a DD. Takes double damage whilst its active.

## Bozzetto Warlock (BLM, All Difficulties):
### Abilities & Spells
- **Chainspell**: Should be kept silenced to prevent **Death**. Will take double damage for the duration of this, even whilst silenced.
- **Death**: Favors in particular during **Chainspell**. Unknown if it has access to this on lower difficulties.
- **Sleepga I/II**: Will use frequently if not silenced.
