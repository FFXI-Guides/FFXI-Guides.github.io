This guide is mostly based on my own experience and mainly focused on the basics needed to get your synergy skill level to 80 as fast as possible.

If you’d like to delve deeper into synergy or look into different leveling methods you can check out other guides, such as the [Synergy Guide by Ohgami](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Synergy_Guide_by_Ohgami). 

Please feel to PR any suggestions so I can improve the guide!

### What is Synergy?
Synergy is a unique crafting system used to make/upgrade some unique items. Sometimes it can be used as an alternative to synthesis.
Unlike regular synthesis that only requires materials for the recipe and some luck, synergy is a bit more involved. You need to balance elemental energies by **feeding fewell** to a synergy furnace.
It is possible to participate in synergy solo as well as in a party of up to 6 people.
**You won’t lose your materials after a failed synergy attempt**, which is its main advantage.

### Prerequisites
Before we start synergizin’ there are some things to prepare:

- **Patience** – Leveling synergy can be incredibly boring and repetitive, as well as highly dependent on your luck, so be ready to spend a lot of time on it.

- **3-6 million gil** - This is needed to replenish fewell the fast way. The amount may vary since skillups are chance-based.
    - Technically you have the choice of crafting fewell yourself, but this would require additional time for preparations and leveling alchemy to 30. If you have a ton of spare elemental crystals, they can be traded for fewell too.

- **Silver Earring** + 
    - **Federation**/**Kazham**/**Empire**/**Nashmau Waystones** – Used at levels 1, 30, 40 and 50 respectively. Both the earring and waystones are cheap to buy from NPCs.

- **Vitriol (*2 pcs*.)** +
    - **Silver**/**Mythril**/**Gold**/**Platinum Leaves** (*4 of each*) – The leaves are used at levels 40, 50, 60 and 70 respectively. Rarely appear on AH; [possible to grow yourself](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Synergy_Guide_by_Ohgami#About_the_leaves).

- **Model Synergy Furnace** (*optional*) - Mog house furnishing that increases synergy skillup rate. Only available during certain repeat login campaigns. Try to get it if you plan to level synergy.

- **Gear** (*optional*) – If you have one of the crafting skills at least at Craftsman (61-70) and synergy at least at Apprentice (41-50), you can buy an apron for your crafting job of choice (100k guild points) and synergize a smock. Smocks for different crafting jobs give different perks during synergy. Weaver’s smock is especially useful as it gives the ability to repair the synergy furnace more effectively.  *Gear can be useful, but not at all necessary for leveling.*

- **A crafting job at Veteran rank** (*lv. 91-100*) – Synergizing a crafter stall is the easiest way to level the 70-80 synergy skill range. All of them need somewhat rare materials and an appropriate crafter emblem (15k guild points).

### Starting out
After you get your synergy crucible key item from a synergy engineer located next to any of [these furnaces](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Synergy_Furnace), you can start the process of synergy. 

First, you claim a furnace by targeting and interacting with it. Then you quickly trade the recipe materials to the furnace. Interact with it once more and you’ll see a function menu. The only important options here are **Feed Fewell** and **Operate Furnace**.

### Feed Fewell
The **Feed Fewell** option is how you increase elemental power of the crafted item. You basically have to balance all elements listed in the recipe as close as possible to the target power numbers to have the maximum chance of successful craft. Feeding fewell has a chance to give a skillup.

After you feed any type of fewell to the furnace, you will get furnace readings in your chat log. Pay attention to the **impurity ratio** and how much it increases with each fewell feed, that’s the most important metric for now. 

**Feeding fewell** increases **internal pressure** which in turn causes **elemental leaks** to happen. Don’t worry if you get one, as it doesn’t matter when leveling.

### Operate Furnace
The **Operate furnace** option opens up another list of options. We will be actively using only a handful of them while leveling. All of them have a chance to give a skillup when used. The options are as follows;

- **Thwack furnace** – Can prevent an explosion at a low success rate, but reduces furnace HP. *Don’t use* unless you accidentally increase impurity **past 30%** and the furnace is about to explode.

- **Operate pressure handle** – Decreases **internal pressure**. Only use when the furnace HP is at 15-20% and the **impurity ratio** is low. 
    - In my experience way faster than feeding fewell meaning you can have more chances at skillups.
    - The downside is that it costs 3 Dark Fewell per use.

 - **Operate safety lever** – *The most important function*. If you go over 30% **impurity ratio**, the furnace has a very high chance of exploding. Lowering **impurity ratio** will give you the best chance of preventing explosions. Try to get as close to 30% ratio as possible without going over and then use this option to lower impurities.
    - Needs 6 Dark Fewell per use.

- **Repair Furnace** – Restores furnace HP (you can see it in the same place as targeted enemy or NPC health). At about 50% HP, go wild and use it all. If you're lucky, you will get a lot of skillups in a very short amount of time.
    - Needs 6 Light Fewell per use.

- **Recycle Strewn Fewell** – *Useless* when leveling.

### Training
Every 5 levels you can talk to the synergy engineer and train one of your synergy abilities. My priority was upgrading; 
1) **Operate Safety Lever** 
2) **Feed Fewell** 
3) **Repair furnace**

 I tried to keep them all of them at the same level instead of focusing on one.
- Ignore **Thwack** and **Recycle Fewell**.

### Leveling Process
The main steps of this leveling method are:
- **Feeding fewell** to the furnace until the impurity ratio reaches **30%**.
- **Operating safety lever** to purge impurities.
- When the furnace is at 50% HP, burn through your Light Fewell by **repairing** it.
- When the furnace HP nears 15%, start using **operate pressure handle** until you’re out of Dark Fewell.
    - If the furnace still has HP left, feed appropriate Fewell.

- **Never manually end synergy.** Let the HP get to 0% and fail so you can get the materials back and repeat the process.
- Don’t forget to train your synergy abilities every 5 levels!

If you follow these steps, it's possible to get ~7 levels per hour.

Good luck!
