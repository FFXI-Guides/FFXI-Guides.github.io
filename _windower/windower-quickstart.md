**Windower** is a commonly used program by Final Fantasy XI players that provides extra functionality to the game via plugins and addons. It also provides a built-in config via its launcher to allow you to tweak settings normally only accessible via the Final Fantasy XI Config program, normally with much higher possible values than the official config program allows. It is strongly recommended you make use of Windower to have the best experience in Vana'diel.

###### Important Note: You need to have started Final Fantasy XI or Final Fantasy XI Config at least once prior to using Windower, so it can detect where your game is installed.

1. Head over to the [Windower website](https://www.windower.net) and grab the latest version of Windower (alternatively, click [here](https://files.windower.net/4/live/Windower.exe)).
2. Move Windower.exe out of your downloads directory, and somewhere safe, inside it's own folder. Do *not* put it in the PlayOnline directory, and I would also recommend not putting it in Program Files (x86) as this can cause permission issues down the line. 
3. Start it up once you have moved it into a safe place, and it will download the required files needed for it to run. 
4. It will present you with a small window with 3 tabs on it, the Profiles, Addons and Plugins tabs.
5. In the Profiles tab, click on the pencil icon at the bottom, which will bring up the config for the Default profile. Change settings as desired. A table explaining each setting is available in the official Windower documentation, found [here](https://docs.windower.net/profiles/#windower-settings).
6. When you're done changing settings, click the back button at the top of the window.
7. Click the pin icon at the bottom of the Profiles tab, to place a shortcut on your desktop that will skip the Windower launcher, if desired.

That's it! You're ready to move onto the [Recommended Plugins and Addons Guide](/Guides/Windower/Recommended-Plugins-Addons.md).
