### Introduction

This guide provides a list of available plugins and addons for the Windower program for Final Fantasy XI. This is a list of plugins and addons I have found helpful or basically required for playing Final Fantasy XI in the modern age. Please keep in mind this guide is aimed at the retail version of Final Fantasy XI, as it is generally recommended you use [Ashita](https://ashitaxi.com/) for private servers.

### Recommended Plugins
Plugins are (in most cases) closed sourced additions authored and maintained by the Windower team themselves, as such they are only available via the Windower Launcher and can lack the same level of customisation that addons can provide.

See the table below for a list of plugins I recommend you have installed. 

###### A ⭐ by the plugin's name denotes that a plugin is *strongly* recommended or very helpful.

### Hidden Plugins
Within the Windower launcher, there are a few plugins hidden behind a keyboard combo which may be familiar to those of you who have been playing video games a long time. Enter the following with your keyboard whilst you have the Windower launcher in focus, and on the plugins tab.

These plugins are hidden as such because they provide questionable functionality to the game, outside of the usual enhancements and more into the realm of possible cheats. This section is only provided due to one of the plugins being highly helpful for endgame gameplay, and the other plugins are used at your own risk. 
###### A ⭐ by the plugin's name denotes this plugin is recommended and helpful. **Anything else in this table is used at your own risk.**

### Recommended Addons

The real meat of Windower's customisation can be found in addons. These differ from plugins in the way that anyone is able to write an addon for Windower (which makes use of the Lua programming language) and put it out into the world, as such they can come from many different places and authors, and can break if the original author has moved on from the FFXI community and nobody has fixed up their code. I will make a best effort to ensure the addons listed below are up-to-date and work, but please feel free to contact me if an addon is no longer working and I shall remove it from the list. The Windower development team also maintain and curate a list of addons available from the Windower launcher, and these will be marked as such. 

###### A ⭐ by the addons's name denotes that a plugin is *strongly* recommended or very helpful.
